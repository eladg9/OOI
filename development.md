Thoughts for the next version:
==============================

1.  Currently if there are too many observations in the same district, the prediction process can face memory issues. A possible solution is to divide large districts into artificial sub-districts (but that will come at the expense of running time).

2.  Currently there is no option to calculate the OOI without X, but actually it can be done only with X.location.
