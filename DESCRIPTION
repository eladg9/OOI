Description:
  Calculates the Outside Option Index proposed by Caldwell and Danieli 
  (2018). This index uses the cross- sectional concentration of similar workers 
  across job types to quantify the availability of outside options as a function of 
  workersâ€™ characteristics (e.g. commuting costs, preferences, and skills.)
